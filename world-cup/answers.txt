Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The top ones, which are the important ones change.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 10000 because it is below a second, and it is accurate when compared to 100,000.
